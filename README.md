# TAROT PROJECT

I'm working on this project to create an app that allows users to access tarot card readings anytime, anywhere.

The app offers various tarot spreads, from simple three-card readings to more complex readings. You can choose from a variety of decks, each with its own unique style and symbolism.

Whether you're seeking guidance on love, career, spirituality, or any other area of your life, the Tarot app can provide you with a fresh perspective and a deeper understanding of your situation, or to have fun exploring the rich history and mythology of the tarot.

The goal of the app is to make each reading a mini adventure, inviting you to dive deeper into the mysteries of the human experience.

Overall, the Tarot app is a powerful tool for anyone looking to gain greater clarity and insight into their life.
